## üìå Overview

Web scraping is a popular technique used to collect data from websites for further analysis and manipulation. This project employs web scraping using the **Semantic Scholar API** to determine whether there is a **correlation between the value of a researcher's Discovery Grant (DG)** and the **citation count** for their respective publications in the last 15 years, using information from the **Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)** website.

Statistical tests were performed using the **SciPy** library to calculate the **correlation coefficient, R**, between the two datasets.

> This project specifically explores correlations within **Computer Science programs in Canadian universities**. However, the code can easily be modified to explore other fields of study.
